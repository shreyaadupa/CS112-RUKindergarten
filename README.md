# Personal Note
Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shreya! ðŸ¤—

This is the RUKindergarten Assignment from the Rutgers CS112 Course. 

Note to future students: it's an overall easy assignment! Have fun with it!

Below are the assignment instructions:

# Overview
In this assignment you will simulate activities in a kindergarten classroom.

You will simulate the students standing in a line, the students on their seats, and the students playing musical chairs.

The assignment uses:

a Singly Linked List to simulate student standing in a line.
a 2D array to simulate students at their seats.
a Circular Linked List to simulate students sitting on chairs to play the musical chairs game.

# Implementation
Overview of files provided
Student class which holds a studentâ€™s information.
SNode class represents the node object to be used in the linked structures. It contains a reference to a Student object and a reference to the next node in the list.
Classroom class holds all of the methods to be written and that will be tested when running the game. Edit the empty methods with you solution, but DO NOT edit the provided ones or the methods signatures of any method. This is the file you submit. 
Driver class, which is used to test your methods interactively. The classroom state will be printed after every method is used. Feel free to edit this file, as it is provided only to help you test your code. It is not submitted and it is not used to grade your code.
StdRandom class contains the StdRandom.uniform(n) method that you will use in the method that plays the musical chairs game.
StdIn and StdOut, which are used by the driver. Do not edit these classes..
Multiple text files. Feel free to edit them or even make new ones to help test your code. They are not submitted.
Files containing student information.
Files containing seat location in the classroom.
Classroom.java
DO NOT add new import statements.
DO NOT change any of the methodâ€™s signatures.
You are encouraged to write helper methods as you see fit. Just make sure that they are private.
The class contains:

studentInLine which refers to the first student in the singly linked list.
musicalChairs which refers to the LAST student in the circularly linked list when the game is being played.
seatingLocation which is a 2D boolean array that shows which seats exist for students to seat at.
studentsSitting which is a 2D Student array that contains the students when they are sitting.
NOTE: seatingLocation and studentsSitting are parallel arrays meaning that seatingLocation[i][j] also refers to the same seat in studentsSitting[i][j]
provided methods that are used by the driver and empty methods you are expected to write your code in.
the printClassroom() function can be used to show the state of the classroom (eg. the states of students in line, seating, and musical chairs) at any time in your code.
Methods to be implemented by you:

# 1. enterClassroom
This method simulates students standing in line and coming into the classroom (not leaving the line).
To complete this method do:

Read a student from the input file.
Create a Student object with the information read from file.
Create a SNode object that holds the Student object from step 2.
Insert the SNode from step 3 to the front of the singularly linked list studentsInLine. 
You have been provided some input files to test this method (students1.in, students2.in, students3.in, students4.in). The format is as follows:

One line containing an integer representing the number of students in the file (one per line)
Several lines (one for student) containing students first name, last name, and height, space separated
Use the StdIn library to read from a file:

StdIn.setFile(filename) opens a file to be read
StdIn.readInt() reads the next integer value from the opened file (weather the value is in the current line or in the next line)
StdIn.readString() read the next String value from the opened file
To read one student do:
String firstName = StdIn.readString();
String lastName = StdIn.readString();
int height = StdIn.readInt();

The input file has Students in reverse alphabetical order; so at the end of this method the list will have all students in alphabetical order. DO NOT implement a sorting algorithm, there is no need.

Submit Classroom.java with this method completed under Early Submission to receive extra credit.
This is the expected output for students1.in


# 2. setupSeats
This method creates the classroom seats. Imagine that someone is putting down seats on a rectangular or square room.

We will use a 2D array to simulate a room where each cell of the array can have a seat or not.
The instance variable seatingLocations is the 2D boolean array that shows which seats exist for students to seat at.
The instance variable studentsSitting is the 2D array that contains the students when they are seating.
To complete complete this method do:

Read the input file to create the seating arrangement for 2D boolean array seatingLocations 
Initialize the 2D Student array studentsSitting to be of the same size.
The input file format is as follows:

The first line contains an integer representing the number of rows in the classroom, say r
The second line contains an integer representing the number of columns in the classroom, say c
Number of r lines, each containing c true or false values (true denotes a seat exists, false denotes that there is no seat at that position in the classroom)
Use the StdIn library to read from a file:

StdIn.setFile(filename) opens a file to be read
StdIn.readInt() reads the next integer value from the opened file (weather the value is in the current line or in the next line)
StdIn.readBoolean() read the next boolean value from the opened file (weather the value is in the current line or in the next line)
This method DOES NOT seat students on the seats.
This is the expected output for students1.in and seating1.in:


# 3. seatStudents
This method simulates students taking their seats in the Kindergarten classroom. Assume that the students are currently in studentsInLine and that there are enough available seats to seat all students in the line.
This method will populate the 2D array studentsSitting.
Students will be seated starting at the first row, first seat (studentsSitting[0][0] if a seat is present at that location). Once the first row is filled, continues into the next row.
It uses the seatingLocations array to determine if a seat exists at a location.
A student can sit at seat studentsSitting[i][j] only if seatingLocations[i][j] is true (seat exists). 
Then seat the first student in studentsInLine and moves on to the second, third and so on.
NOTES

A student is only in one place (musical chairs, seating chairs, or in line) at a time. At the end of this method studentsInLine is empty.
This method depends on enterClassroom and setupSeats. Test those individually on the driver prior to testing this method.

# 4. insertMusicalChairs
This method represents students preparing to start musical chairs! Assume that the students are in studentsSitting.

Imagine this as a circle of chairs.
This method will take students from the studentsSitting array and add them to the musicalChairs circular linked list.
Students are to be inserted at the end of the linked list by traversing row-wise, then column-wise in the studentsSitting array.
REMEMBER: the pointer to a circular linked list points to the LAST item in the list, and that item points to the front.
NOTES

At the end of this method studentsInLine and studentsSitting have no students.
This method depends on the previous methods from parts 1, 2, and 3. Test those before testing insertMusicalChairs.
This is the expected output using students1.in and seating1.in:


playMusicalChairs
This method simulates the game of musical chairs!

This method is implemented for you.
Write the following methods to make it work.
This is the expected output using students1.in and seating1.in:


# 5. moveStudentFromChairsToLine
This method simulates a student being eliminated during the musical chairs game. 

This method randomly chooses a student to be eliminated from musicalChairs. 
Use StdRandom.uniform(x), where x is the number of students currently in musicalChairs, to get a number n between 0 (inclusive) and x (exclusive).
Remove the student at position n from musicalChairs. Position 0 is the first student.
Notice that the driver is setting a seed for the random number generator. The seed value is 2022.
Once the student is removed from the chairs call insertByHeight to insert the student into studentsInLine.
Watch this video for more information.
Note: this method depends on insertMusicalChairs and insertByHeight.


# 6. insertByHeight
Each student that is eliminated from the musical chairs game is put back in the line (studentsInLine linked list) by height order.

The eliminated student is given as as parameter
Iterate through studentsInLine searching for a student that is taller than the eliminated student. You will have 3 cases:
eliminated student is the shortest, insert at the front of the list.
eliminated student is the tallest, insert at the end of the list.
eliminated student is not the shortest or tallest, insert in the middle of the list.
When inserting into the list, a student will be insert AFTER all students of the same height.
Watch this video for more information.
This method is called from moveStudentFromChairsToLine() to insert a student that was eliminated from the musical chairs game. In the driver, you can test this method independently using moveStudentFromChairsToLine.

# 7. eliminateLosingStudents
This method eliminates all students from musicalChairs except the winner.

Obtain the number of students currently in the musicalChairs, call it size.
Repeatedly call moveStudentFromChairsToLine with the size until one player is left.
Donâ€™t forget to update size after each call as the number of students in the chairs decreases by 1.
At the end of this method one student will remain in musicalChairs, this is the winner! The winner doesnâ€™t leave the musical chairs to enter the line.

All other students will be standing on the line in ascending order by height.

NOTE: this method depends on all previous methods.


# 8. seatMusicalChairsWinner
This method will seat the winner of the musical chairs game!

After the game of playMusicalChairs, you must seat the winner first!

If musical musicalChairs contains only one node (that is, the winner), delete the node. The list will be empty.
Insert the student object into the first empty spot in the classroom (seatingStudents).
